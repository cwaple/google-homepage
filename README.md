The google-homepage project is meant to mimic the look of the google homepage in order to improve my HTML and CSS skills. 

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

Notes: 
    Learned that size percentages of an item, such as an input text bar, are relative to other items in the div, such as the google image. So 100% width will be the width of the google logo image.
